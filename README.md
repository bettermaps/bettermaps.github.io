#FlowKit : Automated Starter Kit
Flowkit is a simple html boilerplate and gulp based starter kit for web developers but totally self automated. It works with the help of gulp to make your workflow so easy that you will just forget about it.

   ```js
   gulp
   ```

###Flowkit does the following thing itself :

* Compress all your images.
* Compress all your JavaScript files.
* Concat, add browser prefix and compress all your css files into a single minified css file. 
* Live reload server using `Browser Sync`  with css and html injection as soon as you change the files.
* Everything will be saved in a single build folder. 

###Who can use it?

Flowkit is a free open source project based on HTML boilerplate and gulp so it's totally up to you where you want to use it. 
I seriously recommend it for beginners cause they don't have to waste time setting up their workflow again and again.

It's free, simple and easy to use (who have little knowledge of terminal). 

###How to use?

* Make sure you have `node js` installed on your PC or Mac. Please check if `node js` is installed or not before moving ahead. Copy and paste this command in your terminal and it'll show you the currently installed node version on your machine.

```js
node -v
```

* If it gives you an error then please head over to [nodejs.org](https://www.nodejs.org) and install it now.

* Now open up your terminal and `cd` into your Flowkit Folder.

* When you're in your Flowkit directory type `npm install` into your terminal and let the magic happen. It'll install all the dependencies that is needed to make the Flowkit work. It'll take time according to your internet connection so please be patient.

* When everything is installed as mentioned in the previous step, type `gulp` in your terminal and press enter.

* It'll open a live reload window in your browser and you can see your work updating in real time, without even touching the refresh key. 

Flowkit will handle everything itself and you can just focus on writing beautiful code.
